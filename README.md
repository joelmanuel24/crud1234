### Notes
I tried creating a table on my localmachine using my installed sql server but I encountered some error so i skipped the first part where I should create a table. 
Since we are using code first in our code, we could just install the necessary dependency for sqlserver to work with efcore then execute the migration command in the command line.
With that said, I used Sqlite instead since I cannot work with SQL Server right now.
